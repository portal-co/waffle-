//! WAFFLE Wasm analysis framework.
//!
//! waffle is a *decompiler and compiler* library for WebAssembly: it
//! defines an SSA-based IR (intermediate representation), with a
//! frontend that translates Wasm to this IR, and a backend that
//! compiles this IR back to Wasm. It can be used by programs that
//! need to transform/modify or add new code to Wasm modules.
//!
//! A good starting point is the `Module`: it can be constructed from
//! Wasm bytecode in memory with `Module::from_wasm_bytes()` and
//! recompiled to Wasm with `Module::to_wasm_bytes()`, after
//! modifications are performed or new code is added. A new module can
//! also be built from scratch with `Module::empty()`.
